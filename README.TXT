24. A hash table is very similar to a hash map which is a tool values where you insert
two parameters which are
that can affect its performance initial capacity and a load factor and has 2 
type parameters K and V. How you use it is you create a hashmap then add the 2 values
K and v and then retreive these values check then remove the elements and then iterate.
and get the two values.



26. Using the size method.

27. check code

28 It gets overidden

29. They can each coexist

30.in the code

31. return false

32. in the code

33.check code

34. The main Differences of HashSet and ArrayList are 
Duplicates: Allowed in arrayList not hashset
Order: Hashset No order and array list is ordered and maintains it
HashSet focuses on uniqueness
arraylist focuses on order
The main similarities
they store objects
resizeable
same methods
support iteration using loops

35.Returning words from a hash set gives unique not ordered words and arraylist gives maybe dupes and ordered list
I kinda said this in the question above
